"""
Construct the Integers 1-100 using Six 5s

Objective:

- Produce the integers 1-100 using only combinations of 6 fives and the
  mathematical operations: +, â€“, *, / and !.
- You may adjoin 5s together, so the number 55 is a possible combination of 2 5s.
- You may also use the operation !!, a double factorial.
  (Note: 5!! = 5*3*1 = 15.)
