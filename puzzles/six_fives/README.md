Six Fives
=========

Construct the Integers 1-100 using Six 5s. I've been playing about on this one.
I've randomly generated math formulas and evaluated them.  I store only the 
results that fall between 1 - 100.  This is dull :-).

Rules
=====

* Produce the integers 1-100 using only combinations of 6 fives and the
  mathematical operations: +, â€“, *, / and !.
* You may adjoin 5s together, so the number 55 is a possible combination of 2 5s.
* You may also use the operation !!, a double factorial.
  (Note: 5!! = 5*3*1 = 15.)

Ideas
=====

I'm curious and want to change this problem around a bit.  I want specify a number eg 42 and then search until I find a solution for 42.

I want to find the max and min number I can produce using these rules.

I finally want to find the lowest positive integer that cannot be created using these rules.

These quests should keep me busy.
