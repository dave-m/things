GAME OF LIFE
============

Rules
-----

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

You need to install pygame to use ui_runner.py.  You may work out your patterns on pen and paper first :-)
